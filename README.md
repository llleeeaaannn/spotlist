## General Information
- Stockle is a static, client-side only web application built on vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.
- Stockle was built to function almost identically to the popular game Wordle.
- Wordle is a web-based word game. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.
- Stockle relies on the same concept but rather than using any five-letter word the potential answers are stock tickers of various lengths and the UI and game logic dynamically adjusts to the ticker length of the day.
- The purpose of Stockle is to allow financial market participants and enthusiats to play a fun and mentally stimulating stock related game which also exposes them to new stocks and companies they were otherwise unaware of.


## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Webpack


## Features
Stockle provides the following features:
- A once daily 'Stockle' which is identical for all users who are offered 6 guesses to decipher the ticker.
- A dynamic user interface and game logic which adapts the number of guess squares depending on the ticker of the day.
- Dark and Light Mode alongside a High Contrast Mode for those with visual impairments.
- Statistic tracking stored in the brower's local storage allowing tracking of their scores without necessitating a cumbersome login which could negatively influence user adoption.
